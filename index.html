      <h4>Description</h4>
      <div id="about-text">
        <p>
          This course introduces the fundamentals of programming with a focus on
          crafting interactive digital experiences that challenge, inspire, and
          engage. Using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          along with p5.js library, students will learn to transform static
          ideas into experimental, interactive visual narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course explores the intersection of design and programming as a
          space for experimentation and dialogue. How can we use code not just
          to create functional websites but to ask questions, tell stories, and
          reflect the complexities of contemporary culture? Students will
          experiment with interactivity, animation, and responsive design to
          reimagine how digital spaces can communicate meaning and evoke
          emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the semester, students will work both individually and
          collaboratively on a series of exercises and projects that highlight
          programming as a design medium. For the final presentation, students
          will create a digital zine, which will serve as a hybrid of visual
          storytelling, interactivity, and code. This project will function as
          both a portfolio piece and a personal statement, encouraging students
          to think critically about the role of digital media in shaping culture
          and to question and expose what web design can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the course, students will have a foundational
          understanding of how to use programming to empower their design
          practice, create engaging web experiences, and contribute thoughtfully
          to the digital landscape. While prior programming experience is
          helpful, it is not required. The course is designed to be accessible
          to beginners, with a step-by-step approach to learning the key
          concepts of coding and interactive design.
